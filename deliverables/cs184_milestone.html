<h2 align="middle">Milestone Status Report</h2>
<p><b>Prompt:</b> Summarize what you have accomplished</p>

<p>We have a basic simulation of the water particles up and running. We set up a basic scene where we applied gravitational force on the particles to replicate free fall. We are currently working on scene interaction along with self-collisions.</p>

<p><b>Prompt:</b> Preliminary results</p>

<p>We can visualize how gravity interacts with the water particles (i.e. fall down) and are able to generate a plane (just not exactly where we want it)</p>

<p><b>Prompt:</b> Reflect on progress relative to your plan</p>

<p>We had some difficulties working out the finer details of compiling and running the starter code given. We finally got it working and we have been building on it since. When we made our original plan we knew because of the midterm and other classes we needed to set reasonable standards. We are currently working on scene intersection and self-collisions. We are currently a little behind schedule and are making progress towards finishing all the way through our Week 3 objectives. Overall, we aren't to far behind and definitely can catch back up to reach a majority of our goals for this project.</p>

<p><b>Prompt:</b> Update your work plan as appropriate</p>

<p><b>SCHEDULE:</b> 

<lo>

<li>
<b>Week 3:</b> Finish up collision handling and start modelling the proposed systems and preliminary rendering and deliverable generation
</li>

<li>
<b>Week 4:</b> Ellipsoid splatting and high-fidelity rendering and relax cause we finished early, then panic because we forgot the poster
</li>
