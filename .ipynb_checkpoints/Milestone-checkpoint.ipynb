When we made our original plan we knew because of the midterm and other classes we needed to set reasonable standards. We are currently working on scene intersection and self-collisions. We are currently a little behind schedule and are making progress towards finishing all the way through our Week 3 objectives. Overall, we aren't to far behind and definitely can catch back up to reach a majority of our goals for this project.</p>\n",
